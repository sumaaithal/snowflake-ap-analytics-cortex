# Dynamic Tables

Expert guidance for Snowflake Dynamic Tables: creating pipelines, configuring refreshes, monitoring health, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing performance.

## When to Use

Use this skill when users ask about:
- Creating dynamic tables with appropriate refresh modes
- Setting up dynamic table pipelines with proper target lag configuration
- Monitoring dynamic table health and refresh history
- Troubleshooting refresh failures or performance issues
- Optimizing refresh modes and query patterns
- Breaking large dynamic tables into smaller, more efficient ones

## Dynamic Tables vs Streams+Tasks

**Dynamic Tables are the default choice for Snowflake data pipelines.** For multi-step transformations, chain multiple DTs together—each DT handles one transformation step, and Snowflake manages the dependency graph and refresh order automatically.

```
raw_table → dt_bronze → dt_silver → dt_gold
            (DOWNSTREAM)  (DOWNSTREAM)  (5 min lag)
```

**Only use Streams+Tasks when a specific blocker prevents DT usage:**

| Blocker | Why DTs Can't Handle It |
|---------|------------------------|
| Append-only stream semantics | DTs track all changes (insert/update/delete), can't isolate inserts only. **First check:** can we add IMMUTABLE WHERE on the DT? Consult [optimize/SKILL.md](optimize/SKILL.md). **Or:** use a CI DT with `CHANGES(INFORMATION => APPEND_ONLY)` — see [custom-incrementalization/SKILL.md](custom-incrementalization/SKILL.md). |
| External/directory table sources | Not supported as DT sources |
| Sub-minute latency requirement | DT minimum TARGET_LAG is 1 minute |
| DT → View → DT dependency | Not supported (view cannot sit between two DTs) |
| Stream with static dimension join | ~~DTs recompute full join on any base table change.~~ **Solved by CI DTs**: use `CHANGES()` on the stream side + regular JOIN on static side. See [custom-incrementalization/SKILL.md](custom-incrementalization/SKILL.md). |
| Procedural logic (IF/ELSE, loops) | DTs are declarative SELECT statements only. **Note:** simple conditional MERGE (different actions per INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) is now supported via CI DTs — see [custom-incrementalization/SKILL.md](custom-incrementalization/SKILL.md). Multi-statement transactions, IF/ELSE blocks, and loops remain blockers. |
| Side effects (API calls, notifications) | DTs cannot call external functions with side effects |
| Write to multiple targets from one source | One DT = one target table |

**Decision tree:**
```
Is there a blocker from the table above?
    │
    ├─ NO  → Use Dynamic Tables (chain multiple for complexity)
    │
    └─ YES → Use Streams+Tasks (or hybrid pattern)
```

For migrating existing Streams+Tasks pipelines to DTs, see [task-to-dt/SKILL.md](task-to-dt/SKILL.md).

## ⚠️ MANDATORY INITIALIZATION

Before any workflow, you MUST:

### Step 1: Load Core References

**Load** the following reference documents:

1. **Load**: [references/sql-syntax.md](references/sql-syntax.md) - SQL command syntax
2. **Load**: [references/monitoring-functions.md](references/monitoring-functions.md) - monitoring function router (database context rules + links to state, refresh analysis, and graph references)

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT**: Do NOT proceed until you have loaded these references.

### Step 2: Establish Session Context

**Goal:** Confirm which Snowflake account, region, user, and role this session is running under so subsequent queries land on the right objects.

Run a single SQL probe before any other DT work:

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT() AS account,
       CURRENT_REGION()  AS region,
       CURRENT_USER()    AS username,
       CURRENT_ROLE()    AS active_role;
```

If `active_role` cannot see the dynamic tables the user is asking about, ask the user which role they expect to use and re-run with `USE ROLE <role>;`.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT**: Do NOT proceed until session context is confirmed.

## Intent Detection

When a user makes a request, detect their intent and route to the appropriate sub-skill:

### CREATE Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "create dynamic table", "set up DT", "new dynamic table", "define pipeline", "build DT"

**→ Load**: [create/SKILL.md](create/SKILL.md)

### MONITOR Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "check status", "refresh history", "is it healthy", "target lag", "how is my DT", "DT state", "trend", "drift", "week over week", "month over month", "compare before and after", "baseline", "historical refresh performance"

**→ Load**: [monitor/SKILL.md](monitor/SKILL.md)

For **written** health reports (files, runbooks, “every DT in the schema”), use monitor’s **Present Health Report** guidance: cite Snowflake literals such as **`UPSTREAM_FAILED`**, **suspended** / **`SUSPENDED`**, and **`FULL`** refresh mode when those states appear.

### TROUBLESHOOT Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "failing refresh", "not refreshing", "suspended", "full refresh instead of incremental", "refresh_mode_reason", "why is it failing", "DT broken", "errors"

**→ Load**: [troubleshoot/SKILL.md](troubleshoot/SKILL.md)

### OPTIMIZE Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "slow refresh", "make incremental", "improve performance", "immutability", "break into smaller", "decompose", "speed up", "reduce cost"

**→ Load**: [optimize/SKILL.md](optimize/SKILL.md)

### ALERTING Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "set up alerts", "alert on failure", "notify on refresh failure", "DT alerting", "event table alerts", "monitor failures", "email when DT fails"

**→ Load**: [dt-alerting/SKILL.md](dt-alerting/SKILL.md)

### PERMISSIONS Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "insufficient privileges", "permission denied", "privilege error", "DT permissions", "ownership transfer", "can't refresh", "access denied", "masking policy error"

**→ Load**: [permissions/SKILL.md](permissions/SKILL.md)

### TASK-TO-DT Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "convert tasks", "migrate from tasks", "replace stream and task", "task to DT", "streams and tasks to dynamic table", "modernize pipeline"

**Disambiguation:** If the user's pipeline uses MERGE with conditional logic by change type (different handling for inserts vs deletes), or uses a stream-static join pattern, route to CUSTOM-INCREMENTALIZATION instead.

**→ Load**: [task-to-dt/SKILL.md](task-to-dt/SKILL.md)

### CUSTOM-INCREMENTALIZATION Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "custom incrementalization", "CI DT", "REFRESH USING", "MERGE DT", "INSERT INTO SELF", "stream-static join", "append-only log DT", "audit trail DT", "shape of changes", "imperative DT refresh", "different logic for inserts and deletes", "accumulate history in DT", "schema evolution without reinit", "DT only inserts from base table", "DT has only inserts"

**→ Load**: [custom-incrementalization/SKILL.md](custom-incrementalization/SKILL.md)

**Note:** Route here when user needs imperative DML logic in a dynamic table, or when a standard DT can't express their pattern (stream-static joins, conditional INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE handling, append-only accumulation). For general streams+tasks migration where the logic CAN be expressed as a SELECT, route to TASK-TO-DT instead.

### DBT-TO-DT Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "convert dbt to dynamic table", "dbt to DT", "migrate dbt models to DT", "add DT support to dbt", "dbt materialized dynamic_table", "replace dbt table with dynamic table", "dbt dynamic table conversion", "convert dbt pipeline to DT"

**→ Load**: [dbt-to-dt/SKILL.md](dbt-to-dt/SKILL.md)

### PIPELINE-DIAGNOSTICS Intent

**Trigger phrases**: "pipeline timeline", "Gantt chart", "why was DT skipped", "UPSTREAM_FAILED", "trace pipeline", "critical path", "execution timeline", "pipeline execution", "what happened in pipeline", "pipeline visualization", "what was affected by failure", "slowest DT", "pipeline bottleneck", "pipeline trace"

**→ Load**: [pipeline-diagnostics/SKILL.md](pipeline-diagnostics/SKILL.md)

**Note:** This skill handles both pipeline-wide visualization and upstream failure diagnosis using OTel traces. For non-upstream DT issues (e.g., "my DT refresh is failing", "why is it doing full refresh"), route to TROUBLESHOOT instead.

## Quick Diagnostic Queries

For immediate assessment before routing:

```sql
-- Quick health check for all DTs in schema
SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA <database>.<schema>;
-- Check scheduling_state, refresh_mode, refresh_mode_reason columns

-- Check for any errors
SELECT name, state, state_message, refresh_action
FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY(
  NAME_PREFIX => '<database>.<schema>', ERROR_ONLY => TRUE
))
ORDER BY refresh_start_time DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## Important Constraints

### 1. Incremental DTs cannot depend on Full refresh DTs

Dynamic tables in incremental mode cannot depend on full refresh mode dynamic tables.

```sql
-- ❌ BREAKS: dt_final is INCREMENTAL but depends on dt_upstream which is FULL
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE dt_upstream
  TARGET_LAG = DOWNSTREAM
  REFRESH_MODE = FULL  -- This DT uses FULL refresh
  AS SELECT * FROM source_table;

CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE dt_final
  TARGET_LAG = '5 minutes'
  REFRESH_MODE = INCREMENTAL  -- ERROR: Cannot be INCREMENTAL if upstream is FULL
  AS SELECT * FROM dt_upstream;
```

### 2. Target lag cannot be shorter than upstream's lag

```sql
-- ❌ BREAKS: dt_final has 1 minute lag but dt_upstream has 10 minutes
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE dt_upstream
  TARGET_LAG = '10 minutes'  -- 10 minute lag
  AS SELECT * FROM source_table;

CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE dt_final
  TARGET_LAG = '1 minute'  -- ERROR: Cannot be fresher than upstream (10 min)
  AS SELECT * FROM dt_upstream;
```

### 3. Change tracking must remain enabled on base objects

```sql
-- ❌ BREAKS: Disabling change tracking after DT creation
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE my_dt AS SELECT * FROM base_table;

-- Later...
ALTER TABLE base_table SET CHANGE_TRACKING = FALSE;  -- ERROR: DT refreshes will fail
```

### 4. `SELECT *` fails on schema changes

```sql
-- ❌ BREAKS: Using SELECT * then adding a column to source
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE my_dt AS SELECT * FROM source_table;

-- Later...
ALTER TABLE source_table ADD COLUMN new_col VARCHAR;  -- DT refresh will FAIL

-- ✅ FIX: Use explicit columns
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE my_dt AS SELECT id, name, amount FROM source_table;
```

### 5. IMMUTABLE WHERE restrictions

```sql
-- ❌ BREAKS: Subquery in IMMUTABLE WHERE
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE my_dt
  IMMUTABLE WHERE (id IN (SELECT id FROM archived_ids))  -- ERROR: No subqueries
  AS SELECT * FROM source_table;

-- ❌ BREAKS: UDF in IMMUTABLE WHERE
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE my_dt
  IMMUTABLE WHERE (my_custom_udf(status) = TRUE)  -- ERROR: No UDFs
  AS SELECT * FROM source_table;

-- ❌ BREAKS: Non-deterministic function (except timestamps)
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE my_dt
  IMMUTABLE WHERE (RANDOM() < 0.5)  -- ERROR: Non-deterministic
  AS SELECT * FROM source_table;

-- ✅ OK: Timestamp functions are allowed
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE my_dt
  IMMUTABLE WHERE (created_at < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() - INTERVAL '7 days')
  AS SELECT * FROM source_table;
```

## Stopping Points Summary

All sub-skills follow this philosophy: **NO changes without explicit user approval.**

- **READ-ONLY queries**: Can run freely (diagnostics, monitoring)
- **ANY mutation**: Requires stopping point and user approval

See individual sub-skills for specific stopping points.

## Refresh and performance context

This skill does not persist local state between sessions. Use the `monitoring-functions.md` router (loaded in Step 1) to select the right reference for your scenario.
