# Custom Incremental Dynamic Tables (CI DTs)

Guidance for recommending and creating dynamic tables with custom incrementalization — imperative DML refresh logic using `REFRESH USING` instead of a declarative SELECT.

**Terminology note:** Use "custom incrementalization" (lowercase) for the feature and "custom incremental dynamic table" for the object. `CUSTOM_INCREMENTAL` (uppercase) only appears as the SQL `REFRESH_MODE` parameter value.

## When to Load

**Use custom incrementalization only when standard dynamic tables don't meet requirements.** Standard DTs are simpler and automatically managed — prefer them when possible.

Main skill routes here when user needs:
- Stream-static join patterns in a dynamic table
- Different logic for inserts vs updates vs deletes (shape-of-changes)
- Append-only log / audit trail accumulating over time
- MERGE logic that leverages existing table state (SELF) for performance
- Schema evolution without reinitialization
- Migration from streams+tasks using MERGE/INSERT that can't be expressed as SELECT

---

## Prerequisites

**Load** [references/custom-incrementalization.md](../references/custom-incrementalization.md) for full syntax, semantics, and limitations.

### Feature Enablement Check

**⚠️ MANDATORY**: Before proceeding, verify the feature is enabled on the user's account:

```sql
SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'FEATURE_CUSTOM_INCREMENTAL_DYNAMIC_TABLE' IN ACCOUNT;
```

**Expected values:**
- `ENABLED` or `ENABLED_PUBLIC_PREVIEW` → Proceed with CI DT
- `DISABLED` or no rows returned → CI DTs are not available on this account. Inform user they need to contact Snowflake support or wait for the feature to be enabled.

If the feature is not enabled, stop here — do not proceed with CI DT recommendations.

### Preview Feature Disclosure

Before proceeding, check the current feature status and inform the user:

1. **Verify status**: Check https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/preview-features to confirm CI DTs are still in preview. If the feature has reached GA, skip this disclosure.

2. **If still in preview**, inform the user:

> Custom incrementalization for dynamic tables is currently in **Public Preview**. Preview features are subject to change, may have limited support, and are not recommended for production workloads without understanding the implications. See [Snowflake Preview Features](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/preview-features) for general caveats including:
> - Feature behavior may change without notice
> - Not covered by Snowflake's SLA
> - May have undiscovered bugs or limitations
> - Could be deprecated or materially altered before GA

**Ask user to confirm** they understand the preview status before continuing.

## Workflow

**If arriving from task-to-dt** (user was redirected here because their pipeline uses MERGE with conditional change logic or stream-static join): Skip Step 1 questions and Step 2c (migration checks already done). Proceed directly to Step 2a.

### Step 1: Identify the Use Case

**Goal:** Determine which CI DT pattern fits the user's scenario.

**Decision matrix:**

| Scenario | Pattern | DML Type | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| Enrich incremental changes with static dimension lookups | Stream-static join | INSERT INTO SELF (if source is insert-only) or MERGE INTO SELF (if source has updates/deletes) | Use MERGE when source stream has updates/deletes |
| DT should only capture inserts from base table | Append-only from insert stream | INSERT INTO SELF with CHANGES(INFORMATION => APPEND_ONLY) | Filters to only inserts, ignoring updates/deletes |
| Different actions for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE | Shape-of-changes | MERGE INTO SELF (with METADATA$ACTION filtering) | |
| Accumulate history / audit trail (never update/delete) | Append-only log | INSERT INTO SELF | |
| Use existing table state to limit work (e.g., top-k) | Stateful MERGE | MERGE INTO SELF (with SELF in USING) | State reuse/memoization for speedup |
| Time-window processing without CHANGES() | Window-based append | INSERT INTO SELF (with NOT EXISTS against SELF) | |
| Schema evolution without full reinit | Any CI DT | Either (use CREATE OR ALTER to add columns) | |

**Ask user:**
1. What is the source data? (fact table, event stream, etc.)
2. What transformation do you need? (enrich, filter, merge, accumulate)
3. Do you care about the *type* of change (insert vs delete vs update)?
4. Is this replacing an existing streams+tasks pipeline?

Confirm use case and pattern with the user before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Assess Feasibility

**Goal:** Verify CI DT is the right choice and check prerequisites.

#### 2a. Confirm CI DT is Needed (Not Standard DT)

Standard DTs are simpler. Only use CI DT when standard DTs **cannot** express the logic:

| Need | Standard DT? | CI DT? |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Simple SELECT transformation | ✅ Use standard | Overkill |
| GROUP BY aggregation | ✅ Use standard | Overkill |
| JOIN where both sides trigger refresh | ✅ Use standard | Overkill |
| Stream-static join (only one side incremental) | ❌ Full recompute | ✅ |
| Conditional INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE by change type | ❌ Not expressible | ✅ |
| Append-only accumulation (never delete old rows) | ❌ DT replaces content | ✅ |
| MERGE using existing state for optimization | ❌ Not expressible | ✅ |

#### 2b. Check Prerequisites and Evaluate Against Known Limitations

1. **Change tracking** on source tables:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES LIKE '<source_table>';
   -- Verify change_tracking = TRUE
   ```

2. **Source compatibility**: CI DTs can read from:
   - Base tables with change tracking (via CHANGES() clause)
   - Other dynamic tables (via CHANGES() clause)
   - Static tables (read in full, no CHANGES())
   - SELF (the CI DT's own current state)

3. **Evaluate user's scenario against known limitations:**

   Review the full limitations table in the loaded reference document. For each limitation, check whether the user's scenario would violate it. Key questions to ask:

   - Does the user need multiple DML statements in one refresh? → Cannot use CI DT
   - Does the logic require IF/ELSE branching or loops? → Cannot use CI DT
   - Does it need to call external APIs or stored procedures? → Cannot use CI DT
   - Does one refresh need to write to multiple target tables? → Split into multiple CI DTs
   - Does the user need `CHANGES()` on SELF (the DT's own history)? → Not allowed
   - Does the user expect view semantics (DT always reflects latest SELECT result)? → CI DTs are imperative, not view-like. Rows persist unless explicitly deleted via MERGE. If user needs view semantics, recommend standard DTs instead.
   - Does the user need to clone or replicate the DT? → Not supported for CI DTs

   **⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT if any limitation is triggered**: Present the conflict to the user and discuss alternatives (standard DT, hybrid task+DT, or staying on streams+tasks).

#### 2c. Migration from Streams+Tasks — Pre-Requisite Checks

**If migrating from an existing pipeline:**

1. **Check for stored procedures in tasks:**
   ```sql
   SHOW TASKS IN SCHEMA <schema>;
   -- Look at 'definition' column for CALL statements
   ```

2. **If stored procs are used, inspect their bodies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT GET_DDL('PROCEDURE', '<proc_name>(arg_types)');
   ```

   **Critical check**: Look for multi-statement transactions that do work *beyond* consuming the stream. CI DTs execute a single DML statement — they cannot:
   - Update multiple target tables in one refresh
   - Perform conditional branching (IF stream has data THEN X ELSE Y)
   - Call external APIs or send notifications
   - Execute DDL as part of the refresh
   - Maintain counters or state in variables across refreshes

   **If any of these patterns exist**: The pipeline cannot be fully expressed as a CI DT. Consider:
   - Splitting into multiple CI DTs (one per target)
   - Keeping the non-DML side effects in a lightweight task triggered by the DT
   - Hybrid approach: CI DT for the core MERGE + task for side effects

3. **Map components:**

   | Streams+Tasks | CI DT Equivalent |
   |--------------|-----------------|
   | `CREATE STREAM ... ON TABLE x` | `FROM x CHANGES()` in REFRESH USING |
   | Stream offset (position) | `START AT (STREAM => '<stream_name>')` to carry over offset (requires BACKFILL FROM) |
   | `SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA()` | No direct equivalent. CI DT refresh runs even when CHANGES() returns 0 rows (no-op DML still consumes warehouse credits). |
   | Task SCHEDULE / CRON | TARGET_LAG |
   | Task AFTER (predecessors) | Automatic DAG from table references |
   | MERGE INTO target USING stream | MERGE INTO SELF USING (... FROM source CHANGES()) |
   | INSERT INTO target SELECT FROM stream | INSERT INTO SELF SELECT FROM source CHANGES() |

4. **Seamless pipeline continuation with BACKFILL FROM and START AT:**

   To continue processing from where the stream left off without data loss or duplication, use BACKFILL FROM with START AT:

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE my_ci_dt (...)
     TARGET_LAG = DOWNSTREAM
     WAREHOUSE = my_wh
     BACKFILL FROM my_database.my_schema.existing_target_table
     START AT (STREAM => 'my_database.my_schema.my_existing_stream')
     REFRESH USING (
       MERGE INTO SELF USING ...
     );
   ```

   **Notes:**
    - START AT requires BACKFILL FROM — you cannot use START AT alone.
    - The stream name in START AT must be a quoted string.
    - BACKFILL FROM Iceberg sources is NOT supported. If the existing target is an Iceberg table, you must manually copy the data or use a different approach.

Present feasibility assessment to the user. If blockers exist, discuss alternatives.

---

### Step 3: Design the CI DT

**Goal:** Write the CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE ... REFRESH USING statement.

**Template:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE <name> (
  <column_list>
)
  TARGET_LAG = { '<time>' | DOWNSTREAM }
  WAREHOUSE = <warehouse>
  REFRESH USING (
    { MERGE INTO SELF AS tgt USING (...) AS src ON ... WHEN ... }
    |
    { INSERT INTO SELF SELECT ... FROM <source> CHANGES(...) ... }
  );
```

**Key decisions:**

1. **INSERT INTO SELF vs MERGE INTO SELF:**
   - INSERT: Append-only patterns (logs, audit trails, event accumulation)
   - MERGE: Need to update/delete existing rows based on incoming changes

2. **CHANGES() clause options:**
   - `CHANGES()` — all change types (DEFAULT information)
   - `CHANGES(INFORMATION => APPEND_ONLY)` — only inserts (more efficient if source is append-only)

3. **Column list**: CI DTs require explicit column definitions in the CREATE statement.

4. **SELF references**: Use `SELF` (not the table name) to reference the CI DT's own current state.

Present the CREATE statement to the user for approval before executing.

---

### Step 4: Execute and Verify

**Goal:** Create the CI DT and confirm it works.

**Actions:**

1. **Enable change tracking** if needed:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE <source> SET CHANGE_TRACKING = TRUE;
   ```

2. **Execute** the approved CREATE statement.

3. **Verify creation:**
   ```sql
   SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES LIKE '<name>';
   ```

4. **Verify data** after first refresh:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM <name> LIMIT 10;
   ```

5. **Test incremental behavior** — insert/update/delete rows in source, wait for refresh, verify CI DT reflects changes correctly.

Present results to the user. Confirm correct behavior.

---

### Step 5: Decommission Old Pipeline (if migrating)

**Only if replacing streams+tasks:**

1. **Run in parallel** for a monitoring period (CI DT + old pipeline both active)
2. **Compare outputs** between old target table and new CI DT
3. **Suspend** tasks after validation:
   ```sql
   ALTER TASK <task_name> SUSPEND;
   ```
4. **Drop** after confidence period:
   ```sql
   DROP TASK IF EXISTS <task_name>;
   DROP STREAM IF EXISTS <stream_name>;
   ```

## Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: Stream-Static Join

**Problem:** Enrich clickstream events with page metadata. Only new clicks should trigger processing; page dimension changes shouldn't reprocess all clicks.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE enriched_clicks (
  click_id INT, user_id INT, page_title STRING,
  section STRING, click_ts TIMESTAMP
)
  TARGET_LAG = DOWNSTREAM
  WAREHOUSE = my_wh
  REFRESH USING (
    INSERT INTO SELF
    SELECT c.click_id, c.user_id, p.page_title, p.section, c.click_ts
    FROM clicks CHANGES(INFORMATION => APPEND_ONLY) AS c
    LEFT OUTER JOIN pages AS p ON c.page_id = p.page_id
  );
```

**Note:** If the static side has one-to-many cardinality, use MERGE with deduplication instead.

### Scenario 2: Audit Deletes Log (Shape-of-Changes)

**Problem:** Maintain a permanent log of every deleted row from a source table.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE dt_deletions_log (id INT, name STRING, email STRING)
  TARGET_LAG = DOWNSTREAM
  WAREHOUSE = my_wh
  REFRESH USING (
    INSERT INTO SELF
    SELECT * EXCLUDE (METADATA$ISUPDATE, METADATA$ACTION)
    FROM users CHANGES()
    WHERE NOT METADATA$ISUPDATE AND METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE'
  );
```

### Scenario 3: Top-K Leaderboard (Stateful MERGE)

**Problem:** Maintain a top-3 leaderboard, re-ranking only changed entries against current leaders — never scanning full population.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE leaderboard (player_id INT, total_score INT, rank INT)
  TARGET_LAG = DOWNSTREAM
  WAREHOUSE = my_wh
  REFRESH USING (
    MERGE INTO SELF AS tgt
    USING (
      WITH candidates AS (
        SELECT
          COALESCE(ch.player_id, cur.player_id) AS player_id,
          COALESCE(ch.total_score, cur.total_score) AS total_score
        FROM SELF AS cur
        FULL OUTER JOIN (
          SELECT player_id, total_score
          FROM player_scores CHANGES()
          WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT'
        ) AS ch ON cur.player_id = ch.player_id
      ),
      ranked AS (
        SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
          ORDER BY total_score DESC, player_id ASC
        ) AS new_rank
        FROM candidates
      )
      SELECT player_id, total_score, new_rank FROM ranked
    ) AS src
    ON tgt.player_id = src.player_id
    WHEN MATCHED AND src.new_rank <= 3 THEN
      UPDATE SET tgt.total_score = src.total_score, tgt.rank = src.new_rank
    WHEN MATCHED AND src.new_rank > 3 THEN
      DELETE
    WHEN NOT MATCHED AND src.new_rank <= 3 THEN
      INSERT (player_id, total_score, rank)
      VALUES (src.player_id, src.total_score, src.new_rank)
  );
```

### Scenario 4: Time-Window Refresh Without CHANGES()

**Problem:** Append recent events using a time filter, deduplicating against existing rows.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE DYNAMIC TABLE recent_events (
  id INT, event_ts TIMESTAMP, payload VARIANT
)
  TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
  WAREHOUSE = my_wh
  REFRESH USING (
    INSERT INTO SELF
    SELECT r.id, r.event_ts, r.payload
    FROM raw_events r
    WHERE r.event_ts >= DATEADD('hour', -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
      AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM SELF s WHERE s.id = r.id
      )
  );
```

**Warnings:**
- The time window should be **at least as large as TARGET_LAG** to avoid missing rows between refreshes.
- `NOT EXISTS` against SELF scans all existing rows each refresh — performance degrades linearly as the table grows. Consider periodic purging or partitioning strategies for long-lived tables.
- Rows accumulate indefinitely. If the table grows unbounded, add a separate cleanup mechanism (e.g., a scheduled task that deletes old rows, or a MERGE-based CI DT that expires entries).

## Stopping Points Summary

1. ✋ Step 1: After identifying use case and pattern
2. ✋ Step 2: After feasibility assessment (especially for migrations)
3. ✋ Step 3: After designing CREATE statement (before execution)
4. ✋ Step 4: After execution (verify correctness)

---

## Output

- CI DT created with appropriate REFRESH USING logic
- Verified refresh mode is CUSTOM_INCREMENTAL
- Old pipeline decommissioned (if migration)
